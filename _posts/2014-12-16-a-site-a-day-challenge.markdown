Been away from blogging for a while during my time at DBC but I am back! And you would be SOOOOOOO excited to know that you can expect regular blog entries during the 2 weeks break starting this weekend till Jan 5th!

Today's blog entry I wanted to declare my project of doing a site a day during my 2 weeks away from DBC!

I have thought quite hard on what should be my study plan during the break. Going back to treehouse and codeschool again? Possibly. But during my try prior to start of Phase 1, it wasn't as helpful as I expected. I think online tutorials stops being helpful after certain point. Ok not stops, but definitly diminishing marginal return. Also, it is quite hard for me to focusing on a lecture more than an hour. My ADD starts to kick in and my head is filled with randoms thoughts for activities.

Through DBC I learned I perform really well when given a specific task and a specific timeframe. Thus I want to recreate that model and choose things I could build within the time frame of a day and see the instant result. I had so much fun to work through the challenges, now just instead of working through DBC give me, I will define my own learning objectives and projects to help me achieve those.

Things I want to focus on enhancing and learning to build are:

- jQuery and jQuery UI
- D3
- Angular JS
- CSS or JavaScript animation
- Web Graphics
- Building storefront or using APIs such as shopify

Hence I have started a list to compile a list of potential site ideas that I could build by utilizing above knowledge and practices. And I AM SOOOOO EXCITED to get started!! Last night literally I had such a hard time to fall sleep cause all I can think of are simple doable but cool site ideas. Spoiler alert: sheep counter is one of them. Yup I was thinking of building that into a webpage even when I was trying to count sheep to fall sleep. Guess I am beyong saving.

There will be sites that will take less than half a day to build and site that will take more than a day. But I think this is a good opportunity to practive time and project management to average out a site a day. Even taking time off as consideration. I can finish more than 1 site in a day but will keep the site release pace to one a day. Not to mention I will finally have something to showcase in my portfolio page!

I intend on pushing all sites to Github so they are all open source project. Also for each site I will create a blog entry detailing how I approached, cool things I learned and painful struggle I might have (hopefully won't be TOO many of them, though unlikely). However, before I start anything, first thing to do this weekend is to update my blog page so it can dynamically view through posts so I don't have to hardcode the pages which is so silly!

Hope you are just as excited as me to see my progress and there will be quite some fun games for you to play!!
