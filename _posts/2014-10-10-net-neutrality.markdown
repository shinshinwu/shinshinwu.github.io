For any gigantic indutries, there are always many, many issues. There is no exception for the telecommunication industry. The amount of money they spend on lobbing every year is ABSURD (and ultimately paid by us). The ultimate purpose? So they can pass laws in favor of them in order to make MORE money.

But I think there is a place you have to draw a line. And this line has been brought up in the recent year as the hot topic on Net Neutrality. This May, FCC (Federal Communications Commission) is facing a decision to perserve Net Neutrality or destroying it (NOOOOOOO).

Net Neutrality, if you are still unfamiliar with the term, is referring to the principle that all internet service providers and governments should treat all internet data equally. Service providers can not block certain contents or decide to charge more for certain contents and loading at a faster speed (think of how the cable business is currently run).

The issue comes to be bone of it, it's just another battle with the few telecommunication giants (looking at you verizon and cox) want to explore new ways of generating income and they want to push the government to test the limit (this is also an issue happening outside the US also). This is the first step for these giants to interfere with our Internet data and having authority over what we can access and what we can not access.

That is a violation to our basic right of speech and violation to our right to receive equal internet access.

There is no better way of explaining this than in the great humor of John Oliver:
