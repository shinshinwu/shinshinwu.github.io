Over the years I have completed many types of exercises about my personality, my leadership style, my problem solving style and now my thinking style. It is always interesting to see how I fit into the buckets that others have created. They never fit quite perfectly but they do always point out things about me that I subconciously know but have never verbalize before.

In life and in work, I am a very practicle person. I like facts and numbers. If you want to convince me in an argument, I like to see proven evidence. If you want me to learn about something new, show me how they are used and let me practice myself. When I first started learning coding, I like to mix it up between going through tutorials and videos and doing challenges, mixing it up with building my personal website and utilize new knowledge right away. I enjoy hands-on learning as I am a firm believer that you can never truely understand something unless you have tried it yourself.

The discussion regarding growth and fixed mindset resonnate on a more personal level for me. Ever since my move from mainland China when I was 15, I sort of went on this ride that I can't stop and do not want to stop. Floating from one place to another, traveling and studying in different countries and cities. I love it and can not imagine being satisfied with things I currently have(though I appreciate every aspect of my life). Now again another move to pursue another career path and leaving behind my family, friends and love behind just because I can not stop in this journey. I have no idea where this path will lead me to but that's what is exciting for me. I don't want to live a predictable life where I know exactly where I will be in the next year and in the next three years.

So here's to another year of adventure.
