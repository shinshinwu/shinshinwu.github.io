            <h3><a href="blog-entries/c7-values.html">Values? $$?</a></h3>
            <br><p>Pheww, DBC give me a VAST list of values to choose from... this is difficult.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Looking through the list, there are so many I could pick out that is critical to my happiness in life, such as accomplishment, family and friendship, close relationships (now think of it, interesting they didn't have love on the list), ambitions. meaningful work etc.
            <br><br>
            This is getting to a more personal side, but the one that I ultimately have to pick out is Adventure. And I am trying my hardest to live it up to 5.
            <br><br>
            In the past few years I have been floating around pretty frequently from Boston to London, New York to (god forbidden) Buffalo, now to San Francisco. I am always looking for a sense of adventure. I have to try something new every year or even every couple months or so. Both in personal life and career wise. This certainly have created some difficult personal situations. I don't have much friends I have grown up with since I am constantly moving and it is difficult to keep in touch with so many good people I have met for various length along the road. Keeping a relationship is difficult, thus far I still haven't managed to have a relationship lasted longer than a year. They inevitably end when I move.
            <br><br>But I can't deny who I am and what I want from life. Which to me right now is new experiences. I CRAVE for the sense of adventurism. The worst fear I have is to live the same life every day and know exactly where I will be next year, the year after and the year after that. That petrifies me more than anything, more than my love for my friends, more than my love for my exes. But I can't change who I am and this undying curiousity inside of me. I think I have this little nomad live inside of me and there are many days I want to pick up a backpack and just be on the road floating for a while or never return while I am on the road traveling.
            <br><br>Thus I decided to quit my very comfortable job with a major bank, broke up with my boyfriend, waved goodbye to all my good friends in New York and packed up my bags to be on the move again.
            <br><br>San Francisco, see you in 3 days.</p><br>

            <h3><a href="blog-entries/t6-JavaScript.html">JavaScript or Ruby?</a></h3>
            <br><p>My experience with both languages are bit different. I started learning js a lot earlier than ruby and have always been a big fan. Javascript is a huge powerful tool and contributed as a very big component for the front end developement.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Because of the recent years of popularity of js language, there are soooooo many plug-ins and js library very very talented developers have developed to expand the js universe. jQuery is AMAZING if you haven't tried it out yourself, it makes a lot of common website interactivity tasks so easy and achieveable with one simple line of command. Backbone js and angular js are another two really hot js library right now also and again helps with website layout and constructing a complication full features website a lot easier and less time consuming. Ultimately, the goal for developers is to write less code but accomplish more.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Unlike many extensions and libraries that accompanies JavaScript, Ruby's best buddy is Rails. In DBC phase 0 we haven't touched on much of the subject yet, but with my some personal testing and initial learning on the topic, rails is amazing. It makes a RoR generated website so easy to modify and manage.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Though js is a front end language (though with node it can be used to manipulate server end as well) while ruby is a back end language. They share a lot similarities. Both are object-oriented languages, which means they treat (almost) everything as an object. Ruby and js biggest difference in my perspective is the syntax. Ruby is a lot cleaner in terms of it can separate code according to space and lines versus js you have to wrap everything in brackets. However, a lot of the logic functions in ruby and js are very similar, such as for, while loops, if else statements and they seperate objects by string, number, and boolean values.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The biggest difference I personally think seperate the two is their objective. Ruby is designed to reside on the back end and interact with the sever end versus JavaScript is designed for the front end development and to interact with the user end (browser). However with many tools and plug ins nowadays the seperation seems to become more and more blurred as both can have trenmendous effects on both front and back end development.</p>
            <br>
            <p>There are 2 differences between Proc and lambda and though they are relatively minor, they can make a difference when writing code at times.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Fun fact of the day: did you know that JavaScript actually have absolutely no relationships with Java? Js was initially named LiveScript but during the time Java was so popular they renamed to JavaScript to ride on its popularity. Examine nowadays, JavaScript is more widely used than Java, look how the table turned!</p>
            <br>
            <p>And anyone who have worked with js can feel this pain:</p>

            <h3><a href="blog-entries/c6-stereotype-threat.html">Stereotype Threat!</a></h3>
            <br><p>Ah, stereotypes. Guess I would have a lot to say on such topic since I can cover both the Asian and female front on that. Funny though, until I have arrived in US about 9 years ago(can't believe it has been that long!), my race was a subject I have never really given much thoughts to.
            <br><br>
            Ironically enough, in my personal experience, being a minority has worked to my advantages in most situations. However, it doesn't mean I have ever intentially seeked special treatments because of my identity(with maybe the exception of when I was seeking scholarships). And I have NEVER accepted my minority status as an excuse for under-performance. If anything, they are the reason I need to perform over others.
            <br><br>
            Perhaps due to very strong role model in my family such as my grandmother and my mother, I have always set very high performance standards for myself. If others can do it, why can't I? I have played basketballs for few years with all the boys in my school till eventually they outgrow me and my height has forbid me to perform dunks. In any other area, I have always interested in what is typically defined male dominated subject such as physics and maths(and ironically confirmed the asian stereotype when I came to US).
            <br><br>
            Things got more interesting when I started learning about the web development and programming field. I have done quite a bit research on females in the tech industry. And I have to say such low female ratio really lighted up a fire in me and I felt if not for anything else, I have to prove that I can be just as good of a programmer as any of my male peers. And I wrote down exactly that in my application to DBC. I am used to being an outlier in terms of I have always been the youngest and the few females in my field of study and work field and I love embracing that fact. I consider it to be an achievement.
            <br><br>I think the key is not to use stereotypes as excuses for yourself in any negative situations, but rather a motivator. And I think there is a very fine line about noticing you are different from the rest of your peer group to acting you are different. I think our identities is something we should be aware of, but when it comes down to our day to day life, it doesn't affect how we perform or treating others. Just like, would you have treated two people differently because one person has brown hair versus one person have black hair? Exactly.</p>

            <h3><a href="blog-entries/t5-ruby-class.html">How to use classes</a></h3>
            <br><p>Today you will learn coding using classes with Anna!</p><br>
            <p>One benefits of Object Oriented Programming is that you can create many objects that can be reused later in your code. It helps greatly for your code to stay D-R-Y (don't repeate yourself). So other than creating various variables, what do we do when we need to complete more complicated actions such as run a series of conditional statements?</p>
            <br>
            <p>This is where classes and methods come in.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Think of class as a vast catagory. For example, we have a class called "Shoes" and all types of shoes will fall into this class: boots, sandals, snickers etc. And in this "Shoe" class we have many actions we can take regarding shoes such as putting shoes on, taking them off, tie the laces etc. And all those actions will be different methods that can happen to the class Shoes. If we are trying to express this in Ruby, it will look something like this:</p>
            <br>
            <div class="code">
              Class Shoes <br><br>
                def puttingOnShoes<br>
                  do something....<br>
                end<br><br>

                def tieLaces<br>
                  do something<br>
                end<br><br>

                def takingOffShoes<br>
                  do something<br>
                end<br><br>
                end
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>See, not so difficult of a concept is it? Each methods defined under the Shoe class can have many logical operation inside it such as if else statement to check the weather to see what shoes to put on, do we need to wear socks as well? etc.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The variables you have created in the class can be accessed outside of the class if you want them to. Putting a "$" in front of a variable makes it a global variable and you will be able to access the variable anywhere in your code. "@@" in front of a variable means it is an class variables and it is shared amongst all instances of a class. "@" in front of a variable means it is an instance variable and they are only defined for a specific instances of an object. Here is an example of how they might look under the class Shoes to help you better understand it.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <div class="code">Class Anna_Shoes <br><br>
              $count = 2 #one left shoe and one right shoe!<br>
              @@size = 7 #all my shoes will be the same size!<br><br>
              def puttingOnSneakers<br>
                @wearsocks? = true<br>
                end<br><br>
                end
             </div>
            <br>
            <p>Now do you understand their differences a little better? Different classes can also share variables if one class is considered sub-class of a particular class. Such as my rainboots class should have all the variables and rules at my shoes class(common sense right?).</p>
            <br>
            <p>Ok thanks for attending class for another week! It is the pumpkin season so hopefully you are having lots of pumpkin ale this weekend!</p>

            <h3><a href="blog-entries/c5-feedback.html">To pair or not to pair!</a></h3>
            <br><p>Ah, the ultimate question.
            <br><br>
            I think ultimately this is a personal preference. Some people work much better individually while for others, when it is the right pair, they produce much better results and each one on the team inspire each other.
            <br><br>
            However, I think it is very important to recognize that NO ONE can do it alone. And in order to build more powerful and better programs, we will have to work with other talents. One person's capability and time is limited. I personally have enjoyed all of my pairing sessions and find them beneficial. It really does help a lot when you have an idea and try to verbalize to others. It forces to re-examine your ideas and really think it through. And usually you can receive helpful input from others as well.
            <br><br>
            Having been working in the corporate environment for a while now and feedback is always something very much encouraged because its value to employee's self growth. It helps when others let me know how my actions have affected them because a lot of time, when we act, we are not completely self-aware. And there are ALWAYS ways we can improve. Unfortunately(or fortunately?), no one is perfect.
            <br><br>The feedback I have received have definitely helped me, though I think for a self-awared person, none of the feedback should be complete surprise. One should always reflect on oneself and identify areas of improvements. Other's feedback can give you suggestions on the focuses and approaches.
            <br><br>
            It wasn't as difficult as I expected to give instant feedback to others at DBC. I think the school did a very good job to promote a positive learning environment and everyone's feedback is about how to help others better themselves. So here is to teamwork!</p>
