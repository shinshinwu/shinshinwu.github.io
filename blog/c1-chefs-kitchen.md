I have visited quite few similar Bootcamp program in their location or have attended their events in New York City before deciding to join DBC. Mainly because all programs are all very new and in the cases that many students don't know what they are doing, I hope the staff and their instructors do. Course structure wise I also like the phase system in DBC a lot as it is very well structured and filter out the unlikelies in the begining and make sure everyone is on pace, this is not something I have seen with other bootcamps.

The DBC experience explained in the video is exactly what I have expected. I have had friend participated in another bootcamp program and talking to him really helped me to prep for the lifestyle mentally. I think there is no way one can completely switch his/her career track within 3 months if they are not 200% committed. In popular term: No pain, no gain. But I am very excited to be surrounded by people who are just as eager to learn as me and absorbing knowledge like they have never been before. It will be a great experience for me to discover what I am capable of.

DBC see you in few weeks!
