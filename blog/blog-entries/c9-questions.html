            <h3>Asking Good Questions</h3>
            <br><p>Since I started coding, more so now than ever I realized the importance of asking good questions. Every day when I started studying, endless flow of questions comes to mind. A lot of them will be answered as soon as I finish reading the current chapter. Some of them ligers on. And when I work on code challenge, the terminal often throws me error messages in areas I do not consider have problems in! So after encouters with many question situation, I have concluded the top tips for asking good questions as DBBS (terrible to pronounce I know...) and it stand for: <br>1) Do research, 2) Be Specific, 3) Be Thankful, 4) Spread the Wealth.</p>
            <br>
            <p>More than likely, starting as a web newb, someone else probably have encountered the same or similar problem as you and have posted their questions somewhere. And that leads to my first lesson on asking good questions: DO RESEARCH. Asking a question that you can easily find answers for is a waste of your time and whoever respond to your questions' time. Start with Google, often you will end up on Stackoverflow with an exact question you have in mind and with bazillion great solutions posted below.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In the rare occasion that you find yourself in the no man land that no one has encountered your situation before and you couldn't figure out an answer on any documentation or playing around in terminal. Congratulations, it is time for you to post a question to the grand interweb! Few good places to start is on Twitter (you can post a tweet waiting for others to respond or tweet directly to a knowledgable programmer or community you know) and coders' heaven: Stack Overflow. When posting your question, the principle to keep in mind is: BE SPECIFIC. Tell the audience exactly in what environment you have encountered the problem and the ways you have tried to solve it and how have you failed. It will also help a lot to actually copy and paste the related code snippet for others to take a look at.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Now your question is out in the universe and some one has extended the hand of god and helped you to solve something you couldn't after hours of hair pulling in 1 min.</p>
            <br>
            <p>BE THANKFUL: Remember to say thank you and give them your feedback (if it worked or not etc.) If their answers inspired you and you have discovered some alternative solutions as well, do let them know! This will all help all the other people who will encounter similar issues down the road.</p>
            <p>Last but not least, SPREAD THE WEALTH! If you have a blog, blog about the issue and what you end up doing to resolve it. If you have a twitter, you can tweet about the solution as well. All in all, the internet is an open community. You should always help others if you have received helps from others. Keep the good karma flow!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Find me on Twitter if you have any questions!</p>
