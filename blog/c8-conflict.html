            <h3>Fighting Conflicts</h3>
            <p><br>DBC culture blog topics are getting increasingly personal...
            <br><br>
            By now, especially few years into the work force, all of us should have dealt with conflicts and shame one way or another. Conflicts in the personal space tend to be much more intense because they are personal while confilicts in professional space can happen more often but usually not as personal.
            <br><br>
            The most recent conflict happened to me at my fairly new position with the bank. I had started a new position dealing with corporate communication matters in June. Though at the time I already know my determined intention to leave and pursue coding as a career, I had every intention to do the best I can and push the department as far as I could.
            <br><br>
            Within a month of me starting they finally filled the position of my manager. While she is a very very sweet lady and to date probably still one of the nicest person I have met. We certainly had differences in our working styles and schedules.
            <br><br>One thing I struggeled the most, not much because of her, but because of the job description in general is, in such large corporation as the one I was working at, getting approvals is an insane process. You will have to get layers and layers of approvals for one simple communication piece you are drafting. This can create problems when all your approvers have very strong personalities and different personal preference. There have been few times I proposed changes to the communication pieces in what I consider is the best way of spreading the news. But they were overlooked by my manager. I have brought it up to her twice and the response has been to better fitted with the leadership tone. After few times, it gets fairly discouraging so I stopped providing my suggestions unless there are major issues. And I started to doubt my ability, not in general, but my ability and fit for the position.
            <br><br>Looking at the compass of shame, I think it was the perfect example of withdrawl. This did not help to build a more productive environment and certainly did not improve my sense of fulfillment at my job. However, that did serve as my last straw in my determination to leave the financial service industry in general. I am tired of endless inefficient processes and the ridiculous lengh of time to get anything done. Thus I prefer to take matter into my own hand and build things I can see the results of immediately.
            <br><br>So now, here I am DBC!<br><br>
