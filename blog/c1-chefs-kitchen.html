            <h3>Cultural Blog: Chefs in the Kitchen</h3>
            <p>I have visited quite few similar Bootcamp program in their location or have attended their events in New York City before deciding to join DBC. Mainly because all programs are all very new and in the cases that many students don't know what they are doing, I hope the staff and their instructors do. Course structure wise I also like the phase system in DBC a lot as it is very well structured and filter out the unlikelies in the begining and make sure everyone is on pace, this is not something I have seen with other bootcamps.
            <br><br>
            The DBC experience explained in the video is exactly what I have expected. I have had friend participated in another bootcamp program and talking to him really helped me to prep for the lifestyle mentally. I think there is no way one can completely switch his/her career track within 3 months if they are not 200% committed. In popular term: No pain, no gain. But I am very excited to be surrounded by people who are just as eager to learn as me and absorbing knowledge like they have never been before. It will be a great experience for me to discover what I am capable of.
            <br><br>
            DBC see you in few weeks!</p>

            <h3>Git Blog: Q & A</h3>
            <p>Version control helps to remedy what all human makes - errors. In the case of something goes wrong, you will have the power to turn the time clock backwards and return back to the point in time the last working version exists. Also it greatly helps when you are working on a project with others and you can easily identify the changes others have made. Big note to self when writing codes: TYPO KILLS.
            <br><br>
            Git is a version control tool that it basically keeps an eye for you on your working folder. It taps on your shoulder and tells you "Hey, you have changed this files, do you want to save your changes?" And with combination with tools such as Github, BitBucket and Beanstalk, you can share your codes with others and/or have remote access to your codes.
            <br><br>
            Why is Github awesome? It is free (for the most part), lets you to collaborate with others easily and they have awesome Octocat as logo! (can someone please explain to me why Octocat is the github logo, there must be a background joke here).</p>
