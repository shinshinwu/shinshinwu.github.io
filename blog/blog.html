            <h3><a href="blog-entries/c9-questions.html">Asking Good Questions</a></h3>
            <br><p>Since I started coding, more so now than ever I realized the importance of asking good questions. Every day when I started studying, endless flow of questions comes to mind. A lot of them will be answered as soon as I finish reading the current chapter. Some of them ligers on. And when I work on code challenge, the terminal often throws me error messages in areas I do not consider have problems in! So after encouters with many question situation, I have concluded the top tips for asking good questions as DBBS (terrible to pronounce I know...) and it stand for: <br>1) Do research, 2) Be Specific, 3) Be Thankful, 4) Spread the Wealth.</p>
            <br>
            <p>More than likely, starting as a web newb, someone else probably have encountered the same or similar problem as you and have posted their questions somewhere. And that leads to my first lesson on asking good questions: DO RESEARCH. Asking a question that you can easily find answers for is a waste of your time and whoever respond to your questions' time. Start with Google, often you will end up on Stackoverflow with an exact question you have in mind and with bazillion great solutions posted below.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In the rare occasion that you find yourself in the no man land that no one has encountered your situation before and you couldn't figure out an answer on any documentation or playing around in terminal. Congratulations, it is time for you to post a question to the grand interweb! Few good places to start is on Twitter (you can post a tweet waiting for others to respond or tweet directly to a knowledgable programmer or community you know) and coders' heaven: Stack Overflow. When posting your question, the principle to keep in mind is: BE SPECIFIC. Tell the audience exactly in what environment you have encountered the problem and the ways you have tried to solve it and how have you failed. It will also help a lot to actually copy and paste the related code snippet for others to take a look at.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Now your question is out in the universe and some one has extended the hand of god and helped you to solve something you couldn't after hours of hair pulling in 1 min.</p>
            <br>
            <p>BE THANKFUL: Remember to say thank you and give them your feedback (if it worked or not etc.) If their answers inspired you and you have discovered some alternative solutions as well, do let them know! This will all help all the other people who will encounter similar issues down the road.</p>
            <p>Last but not least, SPREAD THE WEALTH! If you have a blog, blog about the issue and what you end up doing to resolve it. If you have a twitter, you can tweet about the solution as well. All in all, the internet is an open community. You should always help others if you have received helps from others. Keep the good karma flow!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Find me on Twitter if you have any questions!</p>

            <h3><a href="blog-entries/t8-cheatsheet.html">Cheatsheet: What is Javascript Prototype?</a></h3>
            <br><p>All JavaScript object inherites proporties from Object prototype. From example:</p>
            <br>
            <div class="code">var Person=function(<br>profession,name,age,gender){<br>
            this.profession = profession;<br>
            this.name=name;<br>
            this.age=age;<br>
            this.gender=gender;<br>
            this.alive=true;<br>
            }</div>
            <br>
            <p>Here are some its most popular methods and their usage. For example:<br>
            mike.name will return 'Mike';<br>
            mike.gender will return undefined;<br>
            mike.alive will return true;</p>
            <br>
            <p>Now we will define a new object Developer.</p>
            <br>
            <div class="code">var Developer = function(language) {<br>
            this.language = language;<br>
            this.speak = function() {<br>
            console.log("I love writing in " + this.language + "!");<br>
            };<br>
            }<br><br>
            Developer.prototype = new Person("Developer");<br>
            var mike = new Developer("Ruby");</div>
            <br>
            <p>This way, if we call mike.speak(); it will return "I love writing in Ruby!" and if we call mike.profession = "Developer"; This happens because mike as a developer, he inherited the same properties from Person.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Now we will jump into a popular method property of prototypes. The method: hasOwnProperty(). This method return a boolean value to see if the object have property pass to the parameter. Some examples:</p>
            <br>
            <div class="code">mike.hasOwnProperty("language")#=> true<br>
            mike.hasOwnProperty("alive")#=>false
            }</div>
            <br>
            <p>Hope this cheat sheet shed some light on JavaScript prototypes and what are some ways you can put it into use.</p>

            <h3><a href="blog-entries/t8-tech.html">The Savior: Regular Expression</a></h3>
            <br><p>Attended the talk on "Stuff everybody should know" by the CTO of npmjs Laurie Voss and it was very beneficial. One of the "stuff" he pointed out that web newbies such as the grads of coding bootcamps should know is RegEx. So, here is a blog post on that!</p>
            <br>
            <p>So what is Regular Expression? Conflicted with its name, regular expression is NOT so regular as it is not very self-explainatory just by the looks of it. It is a pattern describing a certain amount of text. It is very useful in data validation and searching. For example, one of the data field your website is collecting is user's email addresses. However, you want to validate it that it follows certain pattern such as (for some reason) it has to be 12 charactors long and there should be a number in front of the @ sign.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Yes, there are if else or switch statements you can write to validate that. But think about the large loop you will have to write to complete that. In this case, writing a regular expression to validate your date is the most efficient way to go. Some of regex you probably have seen in ruby codes are \d, \w, \s and such. So here we will make a cheetsheat on what they mean.</p>
            <br>
            <div class="code">\d matches a single character that is a digit<br><br>
            \w matches a "word character" that is alphanumeric characters plus underscores<br><br>
            and \s matches a whitespace character that includes tabs and line breaks<br><br>
            a dot (.) matches a single character, except for line break characters.</div>
            <br>
            <p>By now you probably have also seen some characters floating around in regex. Special characters such as backslash(\), dollar sign($), asterisk(*) etc all means different things and they are refered to as metacharacters. If you want to just use any of those characters as a literal in a regex, you will need to escape them with a backslash. Such as "1+1" will need to be entered as "1\+1". Below you will see anchors in work.</p>
            <br>
            <div class="code">Anchors do not match any characters, they match a position.<br><br>
            ^ matches at the start of the string.<br><br>
            While $ matches at the end of the string.<br><br>
            For example, \b matches the first b in bob while $b matches the second b.</div>
            <br>
            <p>This blog entry is only meant to start the conversation on regex as it is a vast topic (and if were easy to understand, then everybody would understand). Below are two good reference if you want to learn more on the topic:</p>

            <a href="http://www.freeformatter.com/regex-tester.html">RegEx generator with a good reference list</a></p>
            <br>
            <p>Later when I have more time aka actually know better about what I am talking about I will write another entry on the topic!</p>

            <h3><a href="blog-entries/c8-conflict.html">Fighting Conflicts</a></h3>
            <br><p>DBC culture blog topics are getting increasingly personal...
            <br><br>
            By now, especially few years into the work force, all of us should have dealt with conflicts and shame one way or another. Conflicts in the personal space tend to be much more intense because they are personal while confilicts in professional space can happen more often but usually not as personal.
            <br><br>
            The most recent conflict happened to me at my fairly new position with the bank. I had started a new position dealing with corporate communication matters in June. Though at the time I already know my determined intention to leave and pursue coding as a career, I had every intention to do the best I can and push the department as far as I could.
            <br><br>
            Within a month of me starting they finally filled the position of my manager. While she is a very very sweet lady and to date probably still one of the nicest person I have met. We certainly had differences in our working styles and schedules.
            <br><br>One thing I struggeled the most, not much because of her, but because of the job description in general is, in such large corporation as the one I was working at, getting approvals is an insane process. You will have to get layers and layers of approvals for one simple communication piece you are drafting. This can create problems when all your approvers have very strong personalities and different personal preference. There have been few times I proposed changes to the communication pieces in what I consider is the best way of spreading the news. But they were overlooked by my manager. I have brought it up to her twice and the response has been to better fitted with the leadership tone. After few times, it gets fairly discouraging so I stopped providing my suggestions unless there are major issues. And I started to doubt my ability, not in general, but my ability and fit for the position.
            <br><br>Looking at the compass of shame, I think it was the perfect example of withdrawl. This did not help to build a more productive environment and certainly did not improve my sense of fulfillment at my job. However, that did serve as my last straw in my determination to leave the financial service industry in general. I am tired of endless inefficient processes and the ridiculous lengh of time to get anything done. Thus I prefer to take matter into my own hand and build things I can see the results of immediately.
            <br><br>So now, here I am DBC!<br><br></p>

            <h3><a href="blog-entries/t7-oop-concepts.html">Blocks vs. Procs vs. Lambdas</a></h3>
            <br><p>By now you probably have written a lot of blocks and probably don't even realize they are called blocks! So what is a block? Remember all those ruby array iteration you have wrote?</p>
            <br>
            <div class="code">['maple bacon', 'hardwood bacon', 'turkey bacon', 'oreos'].each {|e| p e}<br><br>['maple bacon', 'hardwood bacon', 'turkey bacon', 'oreos'].each do |e|<br>     p e<br>end</div>
            <br>
            <p>Above are the two ways of writing blocks, either with the curly braces {} or writing do...end. Everything is wrapped nicely in a...Block!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Now you know what you have written is considered block, Proc and Lambda is easy! Both Proc and Lambda are types of blocks. Remember when you write ruby methods that include iterations so later on you can just call the methods without writing the itereation codes all over again? That is similar to what Proc and Lambda is. You can set up a block that does something to the input and save it as a Proc and Lambda. Later on, you can call the Proc and Lambda without writing the block of code again. For example:</p>
            <br>
            <div class="code">square = Proc.new {|i| i*i} <br><br> or<br><br>
              square = lambda {|i| i*i}
            }</div>
            <br>
            <p>Both above equations will accomplish the same tasks which is to produce the square result of whatever number is passed into the equation. And as you can see, the Proc syntax is Proc.new {block} while lambda syntax is lambda {block}</p>
            <br>
            <p>There are 2 differences between Proc and lambda and though they are relatively minor, they can make a difference when writing code at times.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The first difference between the two is that a lambda checks the number of arguments passed in while Proc does not. Lambda will return argument error is number of arguments does not match up while Proc will defaultly set nil for any missing argument and throw out the extra ones.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Second difference between Proc and Lambda is that when Proc finishes executing it will return results immediately while lambda will return to the original methods and finish executing all the codes in the methods. So for Proc, if there are other bits left in the method, they will NOT be executed while under lambda they will.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Ok that is all for learning today! If you have any questions please tweet to me @cakeisnotreal!</p>
