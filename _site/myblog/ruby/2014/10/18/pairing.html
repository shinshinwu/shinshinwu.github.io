<p>Ah, the ultimate question.</p>

<p>I think ultimately this is a personal preference. Some people work much better individually while for others, when it is the right pair, they produce much better results and each one on the team inspire each other.</p>

<p>However, I think it is very important to recognize that NO ONE can do it alone. And in order to build more powerful and better programs, we will have to work with other talents. One person’s capability and time is limited. I personally have enjoyed all of my pairing sessions and find them beneficial. It really does help a lot when you have an idea and try to verbalize to others. It forces to re-examine your ideas and really think it through. And usually you can receive helpful input from others as well.</p>

<p>Having been working in the corporate environment for a while now and feedback is always something very much encouraged because its value to employee’s self growth. It helps when others let me know how my actions have affected them because a lot of time, when we act, we are not completely self-aware. And there are ALWAYS ways we can improve. Unfortunately(or fortunately?), no one is perfect.</p>

<p>The feedback I have received have definitely helped me, though I think for a self-awared person, none of the feedback should be complete surprise. One should always reflect on oneself and identify areas of improvements. Other’s feedback can give you suggestions on the focuses and approaches.</p>

<p>It wasn’t as difficult as I expected to give instant feedback to others at DBC. I think the school did a very good job to promote a positive learning environment and everyone’s feedback is about how to help others better themselves. So here is to teamwork!</p>
