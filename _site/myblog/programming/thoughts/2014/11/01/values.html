<p>Pheww, DBC give me a VAST list of values to choose from… this is difficult.</p>

<p>Looking through the list, there are so many I could pick out that is critical to my happiness in life, such as accomplishment, family and friendship, close relationships (now think of it, interesting they didn’t have love on the list), ambitions. meaningful work etc.</p>

<p>This is getting to a more personal side, but the one that I ultimately have to pick out is Adventure. And I am trying my hardest to live it up to 5.</p>

<p>In the past few years I have been floating around pretty frequently from Boston to London, New York to (god forbidden) Buffalo, now to San Francisco. I am always looking for a sense of adventure. I have to try something new every year or even every couple months or so. Both in personal life and career wise. This certainly have created some difficult personal situations. I don’t have much friends I have grown up with since I am constantly moving and it is difficult to keep in touch with so many good people I have met for various length along the road. Keeping a relationship is difficult, thus far I still haven’t managed to have a relationship lasted longer than a year. They inevitably end when I move.</p>

<p>But I can’t deny who I am and what I want from life. Which to me right now is new experiences. I CRAVE for the sense of adventurism. The worst fear I have is to live the same life every day and know exactly where I will be next year, the year after and the year after that. That petrifies me more than anything, more than my love for my friends, more than my love for my exes. But I can’t change who I am and this undying curiousity inside of me. I think I have this little nomad live inside of me and there are many days I want to pick up a backpack and just be on the road floating for a while or never return while I am on the road traveling.</p>

<p>Thus I decided to quit my very comfortable job with a major bank, broke up with my boyfriend, waved goodbye to all my good friends in New York and packed up my bags to be on the move again.</p>

<p>San Francisco, see you in 3 days.</p>
