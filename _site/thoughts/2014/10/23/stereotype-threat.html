    <p>Ah, stereotypes. Guess I would have a lot to say on such topic since I can cover both the Asian and female front on that. Funny though, until I have arrived in US about 9 years ago(can’t believe it has been that long!), my race was a subject I have never really given much thoughts to.</p>

<p>Ironically enough, in my personal experience, being a minority has worked to my advantages in most situations. However, it doesn’t mean I have ever intentially seeked special treatments because of my identity(with maybe the exception of when I was seeking scholarships). And I have NEVER accepted my minority status as an excuse for under-performance. If anything, they are the reason I need to perform over others.</p>

<p>Perhaps due to very strong role model in my family such as my grandmother and my mother, I have always set very high performance standards for myself. If others can do it, why can’t I? I have played basketballs for few years with all the boys in my school till eventually they outgrow me and my height has forbid me to perform dunks. In any other area, I have always interested in what is typically defined male dominated subject such as physics and maths(and ironically confirmed the asian stereotype when I came to US).</p>

<p>Things got more interesting when I started learning about the web development and programming field. I have done quite a bit research on females in the tech industry. And I have to say such low female ratio really lighted up a fire in me and I felt if not for anything else, I have to prove that I can be just as good of a programmer as any of my male peers. And I wrote down exactly that in my application to DBC. I am used to being an outlier in terms of I have always been the youngest and the few females in my field of study and work field and I love embracing that fact. I consider it to be an achievement.</p>

<p>I think the key is not to use stereotypes as excuses for yourself in any negative situations, but rather a motivator. And I think there is a very fine line about noticing you are different from the rest of your peer group to acting you are different. I think our identities is something we should be aware of, but when it comes down to our day to day life, it doesn’t affect how we perform or treating others. Just like, would you have treated two people differently because one person has brown hair versus one person have black hair? Exactly.</p>
