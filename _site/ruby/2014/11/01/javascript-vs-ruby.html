    <p>My experience with both languages are bit different. I started learning js a lot earlier than ruby and have always been a big fan. Javascript is a huge powerful tool and contributed as a very big component for the front end developement.</p>

<p>Because of the recent years of popularity of js language, there are soooooo many plug-ins and js library very very talented developers have developed to expand the js universe. jQuery is AMAZING if you haven’t tried it out yourself, it makes a lot of common website interactivity tasks so easy and achieveable with one simple line of command. Backbone js and angular js are another two really hot js library right now also and again helps with website layout and constructing a complication full features website a lot easier and less time consuming. Ultimately, the goal for developers is to write less code but accomplish more.</p>

<p>Unlike many extensions and libraries that accompanies JavaScript, Ruby’s best buddy is Rails. In DBC phase 0 we haven’t touched on much of the subject yet, but with my some personal testing and initial learning on the topic, rails is amazing. It makes a RoR generated website so easy to modify and manage.</p>

<p>Though js is a front end language (though with node it can be used to manipulate server end as well) while ruby is a back end language. They share a lot similarities. Both are object-oriented languages, which means they treat (almost) everything as an object. Ruby and js biggest difference in my perspective is the syntax. Ruby is a lot cleaner in terms of it can separate code according to space and lines versus js you have to wrap everything in brackets. However, a lot of the logic functions in ruby and js are very similar, such as for, while loops, if else statements and they seperate objects by string, number, and boolean values.</p>

<p>The biggest difference I personally think seperate the two is their objective. Ruby is designed to reside on the back end and interact with the sever end versus JavaScript is designed for the front end development and to interact with the user end (browser). However with many tools and plug ins nowadays the seperation seems to become more and more blurred as both can have trenmendous effects on both front and back end development.</p>

<p>There are 2 differences between Proc and lambda and though they are relatively minor, they can make a difference when writing code at times.</p>

<p>Fun fact of the day: did you know that JavaScript actually have absolutely no relationships with Java? Js was initially named LiveScript but during the time Java was so popular they renamed to JavaScript to ride on its popularity. Examine nowadays, JavaScript is more widely used than Java, look how the table turned!</p>

<p>And anyone who have worked with js can feel this pain:</p>
